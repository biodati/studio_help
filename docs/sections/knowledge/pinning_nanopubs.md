# Pinning NanoPubs

If you find a NanoPub that you want to review later, there's an easy way to do it. Just hover your cursor over the nanopub, and click the thumbtack button on the far right of the NanoPub you want to pin.

You will know that the nanopub is pinned when the yellow thumbtack is visible.

You can also pin a nanopub from the Nanopub Review page.

See [[reviewing a nanopub]] for a description of the Nanopub Review page.

If you want to review the NanoPubs that you've pinned, all you have to do is click the box at the top of the Search Facets column that says "Pinned."

The moment you click on the box, a checkmark appears in it, and all of the search results will be filtered down to your pinned NanoPubs.
