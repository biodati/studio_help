# Editing a Nanopub

If ever you want to change something in a nanopub it can be easily fixed. If you already have a nanopub under Review, click EDIT at the top left.

   Clicking the "Edit" link, will take you to the nanopub EDIT page in a new window.  This appears and acts identically to the Knowledge Creation page after you have saved your nanopub for the first time.  Here you will be able to choose which part of the nanopub you would like to change. BioDati Studio has in-line editing, so just click in the field that you wish to update, and type.
