# How to use Completion when Editing or Creating an Assertion

When filling out the assertions to create or edit a NanoPub, we've tried to make it as easy as possible for you by using the completion method. When you tab to a box, drop down will appear with the different options you might be looking for.

   Once you have selected a subject, relation, or object, it will even show you a helpful description of what everything means on the side.

As soon as you are done and click "+" it will immediately show up in the box below that shows all of the assertions.

   After it's been created, saving your nanopub will run validation, so the computer can help you check for any problems with your assertion(s).
