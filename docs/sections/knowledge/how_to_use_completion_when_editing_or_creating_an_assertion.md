# How to use Completion when Editing or Creating an Assertion

When filling out the assertions to create or edit a NanoPub, we've tried to make it as easy as possible for you by using the completion method. When you start to type in a box, a drop down will appear with the different options you might be looking for.

As you work, a description of the chosen BEL function will be displayed to the right.  The completion engine will try to match what you type within the parenthesis to a namespace:value that is appropriate for the species listed at the top of the page.  (In this case, mouse).

Use the drop down menu to chose a relation between the subject and object of our assertion.

The completion engine will help you with the object of your assertion.  When you have finished your assertion, Click ADD at the right.
As soon as you click "ADD" the assertion will immediately show up in the box below that lists all of the assertions.

**NOTE:
It is not necessary to use the completion engine. You can type or paste your assertions in while ignoring the suggestions.**


After it's been created, saving your nanopub will run validation, so the computer can help you check for any problems with your assertion(s).
