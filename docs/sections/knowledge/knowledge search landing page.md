# Introduction to the Knowledge Search Landing Page

The Knowledge Search Landing Page is the starting point from which you search for existing knowledge and review nanopubs. 

It can be accessed either from the dashboard, by clicking the search icon in the knowledge field (1), or through the dropdown menu under the Search icon in the banner (2).

On the left of the page you will find the search feature (1), and facets (2) which will allow you to narrow your search. Please see [[Searching Knowledge Overview]] for more details.
At the upper right, you will find an icon (3) that allows you to export your filtered nanopubs, or use them to build a Temporary Network (4). 
Please see [[Exporting Nanopubs]], and [[Temporary Nanopub Network]] for more information.

The bulk of the page is the list of nanopubs.  Hover over a nanopub.  The nanopub you select will be higlighted, and hover icons will appear.  These icons are designed to help
the curation process. 

1) The Edge Report for the nanopub.  It presents not just the original assertions, but the orthologized and computed edges associated with that nanopub as well.
2) The nanopub URL
3) The nanopub Reference Report.  It lists all nanopubs associated with this nanopubs citation.
4) Nanopub Export.  It allows you to export a single nanopub.
5) Copy.  Here you can make a duplicate of the nanopub.
6) Pin.  This allows you find this nanopub again more easily. 


Click on a nanopub.  The Nanopub Review will open.
