# Bulk Assertion Uploads

If you have a list of assertions that you wish to add to a single nanopub, you can use the bulk upload feature. First, assemble your assertions in a spread sheet, such that you have three adjacent columns; Subject, Relation, and Object columns.
Copy the list of assertions in these three columns to your clipboard. Then click the Bulk Import button.

   The first time, be sure to look for the browser popup and  **Allow**  Biodati to see your clipboard.

   All your copied assertions should then appear in the curation form.
*Warning â€” the validation for each assertion currently takes about 1 second so very large Bulk loads can take a while to save and show you the validation errors. We are working to speed validation up by at least an order of magnitude if not more.*
