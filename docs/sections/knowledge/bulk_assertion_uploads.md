# Bulk Assertion Uploads

If you have a list of assertions that you wish to add to a single nanopub, you can use the bulk upload feature. 

First, assemble your assertions in a spread sheet, such that you have three adjacent columns; Subject, Relation, and Object columns.

Copy the list of assertions in these three columns to your clipboard. Then click the Bulk Import button.

   The first time, be sure to look for the browser popup and  **Allow**  Biodati to see your clipboard.

   All your copied assertions should then appear in the curation form.
   
   Validation is run in the background after you save your assertions.
   
*Warning â€” the validation for each assertion currently takes a fraction of a second, but very large Bulk loads can take a while for validation to complete.

If validation is not complete after the initial save, You can continue to work on that nanopub, or another, then resave or reload to see the updated validation.
