# Using the Fix status

Our fix status is a new feature we made for nanopubs. This makes it possible to leave internal comments on nanopubs.

   When you finish creating the nanopub, the internal comments will show up in review.

***NOTE: If you change the status from fix to approved or finalized, the internal comments will be removed. The internal comments will also be removed when exporting the nanopubs.***
