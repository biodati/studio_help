# Nanopub Statuses and What They Mean

When you're creating or searching for a nanopub you'll see that we now have statuses on nanopubs: Draft, Review, Fix, Approved, Rejected, and Finalized.

![[knowledge_42.png]]

Draft: Nanopub is in a Draft state

Review: Nanopub is ready for Review

Fix: Nanopub needs to be fixed. Nanopub cannot be used to build Networks.

Approved: Nanopub is approved but not Finalized. 

Rejected: Nanopub has been rejected (terminal status). Nanopub cannot be used
to build Networks.

Finalized: Nanopub has been Approved and is in a final state. It is locked and will be
processed by the BEL Pipeline into the EdgeStore. 

Admin users are allowed to change the status to ‘Rejected and Finalized’ nanopubs.
Regular users may only be allowed to set the status of nanopubs to ‘Draft, Review, Fix, and Approved.’
(This is a temporary solution until the full groups/permissions rollout.)
