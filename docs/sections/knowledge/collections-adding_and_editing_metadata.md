# Collections-Adding and editing Metadata

You can use Metadata to add a nanopub to a collection or to add additional information about the nanopub itself. For example, if the nanopub was created using a text mining approach, you may provide a  *curationmethod*  with the value  *Text Mining.*
When the nanopub is created, or saved for the first time, the default  ***collections***  label will appear. To edit this line and add the nanopub to one or more collections;
*  Click on the collections box (1).
*  Click Edit(2).
*  Type in the collection name in the value field (3).
*  Click CREATE/UPDATE (4).

***Collections***  and  ***Collection***  are controlled terms used to facilitate nanopub facet searches. Always add a nanpub to "  ***Collections"***  as a "  ***List of Strings", even if the nanopub is being added to only a single collection.***  If a nanopub is added to a collection as a string, when the nanopub is saved, the metadata will be edited to  *collections*  ,  *List of Strings*  .
If the Default  *collections*  line does not appear;
*  Type  *collections*  into the label field.
*  Select List Of Strings from the dropdown in the TYPE box
*  Type  *the collection name*  into the Value field. Multiple names may be typed in, separated by commas.
*  Click CREATE

*  Select  **String**   *.*
*  Type  ***Text Mining***  into the Value field.
*  Click CREATE.

    **Warnings:**
The label field is not case sensitive, the Value field is. The computer will read the values  *Test*  and  *test*  as two different collections.
Labels may not start with "gd" these are restricted terms.
