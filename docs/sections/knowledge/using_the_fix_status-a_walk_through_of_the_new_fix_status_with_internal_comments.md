   You can add Internal Comments to let your team know what the problem is, by clicking the Internal Comments Toggle. The Internal Comments field will then appear in place of the Comments field. (The Comments are not lost, just hidden. They will become visible if you toggle the Internal Comments again.)

   The Internal Comments are removed when nanopubs are Approved or Finalized. The Internal Comments are automatically stripped from the nanopub when it is copied or exported, regardless of status.
