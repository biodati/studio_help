# Editing Assertions

BioDati provides assertion validation and inline editing. Clicking the error or warning icon will open the validation results, to help you find the problem. (in this case the Subject is missing a function, p, proteinAbundance).  Use the inline editing to click where you need to make your correction, (1) and type in the changes.

Use the duplicate icon (2) to copy an assertion.

Use the trash can icon (3), to delete an assertion.
