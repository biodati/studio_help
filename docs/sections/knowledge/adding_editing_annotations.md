# Adding/Editing Annotations

You can add and edit annotations in the Annotations field much the same way you add and edit an assertion.

*  Use the drop down menu to select TYPE of annotation.

*  Start typing in the ID field and the completion engine will help.

*  Select the correct choice from the engine, and the ID and Label will load.

Annotations follow the same  *ns:value*  rule, and use the same  *namespaces*  as assertions. If the appropriate annotation type is not listed (ex. chemical), leave TYPE blank, and type in the ID box, the completion engine will help.
