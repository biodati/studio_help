# Adding Assertions

Assertions follow the same rules and formats as the official BEL language. Please refer to <http://language.bel.bio/> .
There are two basic assertion types; subject/relation/object and subject only.

You may use either. Object only and Relation/Object assertions are not allowed.

To enter an Assertion;

*  Click in the Subject Box.

*  Type the correct function or select the function from the list provided by the completion engine.

*  Finish typing in your Subject. If the species is set, the completion engine will help you find the correct term in an appropriate namespace as you type. A description of function and argument help is provided to the right of the form.
