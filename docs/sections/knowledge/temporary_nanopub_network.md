# Temporary Nanopub Network

The Temporary Network feature allows you to create a temporary network from the Assertions in the selected set of Nanopubs. These assertions are mapped into a temporary network for quick review while curating a set of nanopubs.

Please note the limitations:

1.  They are not run through the BEL Pipeline (no canonicalization, orthologization, computed edges)

2.  The draft networks are automatically deleted after 4 hours.

3.  They are not listed in the Network search results.

4.  Temporary Networks have a limit of 1000 Nanopubs

To narrow down the Nanopubs that you will use for your draft network:

1.  Start a Nanopub search

2.  Filter it (search or facet filters to < 1000 Nanopubs

3.  Select TempNetwork option

   Once you've selected 'TempNetwork,' it will lead you right to its own network page where you can treat it like any other network - including network visualization.
