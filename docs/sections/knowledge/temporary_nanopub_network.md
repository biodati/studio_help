# Temporary Nanopub Network

The Temporary Network feature allows you to create a temporary network from the assertions in the selected set of nanopubs. These assertions are mapped into a temporary network for quick review while curating a set of nanopubs.

Please note the limitations:

1.  They are not run through the BEL Pipeline (no canonicalization, orthologization, computed edges)

2.  The draft networks are automatically deleted after 4 hours.

3.  They are not listed in the Network Search results.

4.  Temporary Networks have a **limit of 1000 assertions**

To narrow down the nanopubs that you will use for your draft network:

1.  Start a nanopub search (Search Knowledge).

2.  Filter it (search or facet filters) to < 1000 Assertions).  

3.  Click "TempNetwork".

   Once you've selected 'TempNetwork,' it will lead you right to its own network page where you can treat it like any other network - including network visualization, and making a permanent copy of the TempNetwork.
