   If you change your mind about which Annotations to select, or want to come back to it later, click the "i" icon (4). If you click the goto page icon (5), the PubMed citation page will open in a new window, so you can refer to it while working.

   If your Citation does not have a PubMed ID, it's not a problem. Click the arrow to the right of Citation Type, to open the drop-down menu and select the tab which is appropriate for your citation. Then just type in the citation information. With inline editing it is easy to click on a field and edit the information!
Now, check the species (6). The form defaults to human. To change species, click and type. It is important to set the species before you add assertions, because the completion engine will suggest standardized identifiers that are species specific as you add your assertions. Next, add the evidence on which you will base your assertions (7).

Annotations are easy to edit and add. Hover-over or click-on an Annotation field. A set of three icons will appear, (8), which will allow you to save, copy, or delete the Annotation. To Edit an Annotation, just click in the desired field and type. To Add an Annotation, Click on an empty Annotation Field at the top, (9), and type. The completion engine will help you.
