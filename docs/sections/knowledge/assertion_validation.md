# Assertion Validation

Assertions are validated in the background when the nanopub is saved. There are four validation icons that may be displayed to the left of each assertion.

   Icons are updated when the nanopub is saved or reloaded. If the assertion is not formatted properly, the computer will be unable to parse the statement, and the assertion will generate an  *error*  when saved or reloaded. If a value is not found in the chosen namespace, the assertion will generate a  *warning*  when it is saved or reloaded.
   
Assertions that receive a warning can be used to generate edges, but cannot be canonicalized. Assertions that receive an error must be corrected before they can be used. 
   
Click on the error or warning icon for detailed information about the errors or warnings in each assertion.
