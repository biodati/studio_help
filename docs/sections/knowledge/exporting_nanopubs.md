To export an individual nanopub, click export from the hover icons that appear above an individual nanopub **(2)**.

The export option for individual nanopubs is also available under Nanopub Review **(3)**, and in a dropdown menu on the nanopub Creation and Edit pages **(4)**.

   In order to see them on your computer you will need a source-code editor, like Visual Studio Code or Sublime Text.
We use  [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)  here, and we love it.
