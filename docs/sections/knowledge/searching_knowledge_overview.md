# Searching Knowledge Overview

When you're ready to search for a NanoPub, you can get there a few different ways. The easiest way is through the home screen, otherwise known as the dashboard.
Once you've landed yourself on the dashboard, you'll see a box that says "Knowledge," under it will be a couple of options. Click "Search."

   You will then see the Knowledge page, filled with thousands of different NanoPubs. You'll see a magnification glass, when you click it, a box will pop up underneath to help you with the search. If you click one of one of the words in the box, it will show up in your search area.

   When you select a NanoPub, you will see the assertions but if you want to see the Abstract information all you have to do is click collapse in the right hand corner.

   When clicked, it should no longer have the assertions as the focal point but instead you will see the Abstract. If you want to go back to the assertions, all you have to do is click "Expand."

   You can filter which NanoPubs you're viewing and searching through by utilizing the Facets section on the left side of the screen.

   Check the box next to "Me" to only view or search through any of the NanoPubs you've created. Check the box next to "Pinned" to view or search any of the NanoPubs that you have pinned. If you have a nanopub collection you can also check the "Collections" facet to see the nanopubs in your collection.
