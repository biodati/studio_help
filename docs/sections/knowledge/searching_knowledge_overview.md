# Searching Knowledge Overview
 
## How to find Nanopubs, expand Assertions, and utilize the Facets.

When you're ready to search for a nanopub, you can get there a few different ways. The easiest way is through the home screen, otherwise known as the dashboard.
Once you've landed yourself on the dashboard, you'll see a box that says "Knowledge," under it will be a couple of options. Click the Search icon.

You will then see the Knowledge Search page, from which you can access over a hundred thousand different nanopubs. You will need to narrow down this list of nanopubs to find the ones of interest.  BioDati Studio provides two types of tools to do this: a Search Field, and Facets.

To use the Search Field, enter your search beside the magnifying glass and hit return.  You can directly enter a key word, a PUBMED ID, or a nanopub ID. You can also do a field restricted search. If you double click beside the magnification glass, a box will pop up underneath to help you with the field restricted search. If you click one of the words in the box, it will show up in your search area. For tips on searching, please see [[Advanced Searching]]

You can filter which nanopubs you're viewing and searching through by utilizing the Facets section on the left side of the screen.

Knowledge Search Facets are divided by Status (nanopub curation status), Owners (The creator of the nanopub), Relations (BEL edge relations), Collections, Update Date, original Creation Date, Annotations, Validation, and BEL version.  Check the box next to "Me" to view or search through the nanopubs you've created. Check the box next to "Pinned" to view or search any of the nanopubs that you have pinned. If you have a nanopub collection you can also check the "Collections" facet to see the nanopubs in your collection.

You can page through your nanopub list by using the arrow icons at the top of the list.
