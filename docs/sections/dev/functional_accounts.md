# Functional accounts

## API-accessing accounts - NOT user accounts

We don't count functional accounts against the user limit count. These accounts are for setting up analytics access or integration with BioDati Studio services.

You can use either a functional email account (e.g.  [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#5f3e313e33262b363c2c1f3a273e322f333a713c3032)  ) to create an account in BioDati Studio to use or use the <email>+<func\_name>@example.com (plus) pattern (e.g.  [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email\_address#Subaddressing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email_address#Subaddressing)  ).
  
Use of the plus pattern or subaddressing is only possible if your email service will deliver email to you (for functional account email validation and account mgmt).

These will be separate user accounts, and since they are being used for functional accounts - we strongly recommend that you use different passwords from your regular user account.
