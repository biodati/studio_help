# API Documentation

There are several API endpoints that will be of interest to users.
*Please substitute the appropriate STUDIO\_NICKNAME (e.g. demo, customer1, ...) in the following URLs.*
The endpoints below direct you to a landing page that will then allow you to login to access the API docs. All of the API docs are at the /docs route for each service. The landing page also shows some basic metrics when you are logged in (but nothing if you are not logged in).
