  ## Second level support
If you have a question that needs development support or more investigation, we will create an issue in Github to track it for our development team. We will share the issue link with you in case you want to track it directly, and we will also notify you when the issue is closed in Github.

You can view all of the issues that have been raised on our  [WaffleBoard](https://waffle.io/biodati/support)  . This board shows all of our issues and what status they are in. It is driven by this  [BioDati Github issue queue](https://github.com/biodati/support/issues)  .

*Our Enterprise customers have an alias tag associated with them so they can track any issues reported by their users without having their identity shared.*
