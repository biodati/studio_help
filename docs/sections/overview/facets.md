# Facets

When looking through the Facets which is found on any search, you can scroll through the facets and expand on the options with the little down arrow next to each facet subject. When you click it the options will appear under it, you can hide them again by clicking the arrow that should be facing up now. Below you can see an expanded facet above a facet that is not expanded.

   BioDati also features the AND/OR Boolean logic to revolutionize the way you use our search engine. If you click on the facet once, a checkbox will appear that means "AND," but if clicked twice a + sign will appear that indicates "OR." In the example below I am searching for "Human OR Mouse."

   Clicking "GO" at the top officially load your narrowed down search results.
