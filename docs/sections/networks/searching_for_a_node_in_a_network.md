# Searching for a Node in a Network

There are two easy ways to go about finding a certain node in the visualization of a network. First I'm going to show you how to go about it through the tabular view.
Once you're in the tabular view, you should see it says "Nodes" on the side, click it and you will find a box under the word "Label" that you can type in. That's where you'll fill in the Namespace you are looking for.

   After you've checked the node, all you have to do is go back to the visualization and it will be the only node selected.

   You can do the same thing through the Visualization tab. It's as easy as typing in the Namespace where it says "Search Nodes," right next to the magnification glass.
