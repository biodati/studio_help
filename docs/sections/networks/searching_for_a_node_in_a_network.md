# Searching for a Node in a Network

There are two easy ways to go about finding a certain node in the visualization of a network. First I'm going to show you how to go about it through the tabular view.
Once you're in the tabular view, you should see it says "Nodes" on the side, click it and you will find the three line icon to the right of the word Label. This is where you will find the Label filter option. Type in the box to filter to nodes that contain your entry.

Click on the arrow next to contains to find the other filter options.

You can combine options if you prefer, using AND or OR.  After you have entered the first filter term, a second term can be entered in a new box.

After you've checked the node, all you have to do is go back to the visualization and it will be the only node selected.

You can do the same thing for edges. The Subject, Relation and Object columns all have the same filter options.

You can also sort the list alphabetically (and in reverse). Simply click to the right of the Label. An arrow will appear to indicate the sorting direction, and the list will be sorted.

You can search for a node through the Visualization tab. It's as easy as typing in the right next to the magnification glass. THe completion engine will help by suggesting nodes that are in the network.  Select a node, and it will be highlighted.
