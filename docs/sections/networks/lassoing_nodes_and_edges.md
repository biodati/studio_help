# Lassoing Nodes and Edges

## Visually selecting nodes and edges using Lasso (irregular boundary) technique.

Stay in your saddles, cowboys and cowgirls, because today I'm going to show you how to lasso! The first thing you'll need to do is visualize your network.

 You might not be able to tell which nodes and edges are which, so to make this easier, you should zoom in. To do that, all you have to do is use your mouse wheel and scroll down.
 Or double click on the network without clicking a node or edge.

Ahh, much better. Now I can see exactly which ones I'd like to lasso. All that needs to be done to lasso is find the pencil symbol at the top and then make a circle around which ones you'd like to group! You can also press Shift+Right Click as you circle, the choice is up to you!

As you can see, all the other nodes and edges that are not selected are immediately grayed out. Anything you lasso in the visualization will be selected in the tabular chart as well!
