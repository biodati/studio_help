# How to Reset a Selection Using the Tabular View

As you can see below, I have an active network in our tabular view. I also have a group of nodes and edges selected.

   You can accomplish this act through either the nodes or the edges page. Just click "Selection," look through the dropped down options and choose "Reset Selection."

   Once that's done, all the nodes and edges that were previously selected are now unselected and you can start fresh!
