# Searching Networks


![[networks_15.png]]

You'll find yourself on our Networks page, where you can search for exactly which Network you need.

   Type in the kind of networks you'd like to view. This may also include searching for the creator of the network by simply typing in "Creator:" followed by who created it.
You can narrow your search down through the Facets section on the left. In this case, I want to narrow down my Networks to the ones that have a Node count of less than 50.

   Now that it's been narrowed down, I can successfully find the right Network!
