# Deleting and Adding Edges in Visualizer

##  To Delete:
Maybe you've created a Network and you forgot to add an edge, or maybe you'd just like to delete one. I've got you covered:
Make sure your network is visualized.

   The next step is to lasso the edge that you want deleted, and then look to the top where it reads "Delete Selected Edges."

   You'll know it's been deleted when you see this message at the bottom:

  ##  To Add:
Now that you know how to delete an edge, I'll show you how to add an edge onto your existing network.
Again, make sure your network is active and visualized, then go to the top and find "Add Edge."

   After that you'll see a pop up, you'll have to fill in the boxes with the required information.

   Once you've completed that, you'll see the extra edge pop up in your visualization.
