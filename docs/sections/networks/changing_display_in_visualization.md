STYLE, (2), will let you chose between BEL and  bayesian style displays.

LAYOUT, (3), allows you to chose between: Force Directed (the default), Organic, Grid, Circular, and Hierarchical layouts.  

Smart Nodes and Edges, (4), display the labels only when you zoom in on a network, such that the labels are large enough to be read. 
Standard Nodes and Edge Labels can also be used.

To zoom in on a network, double click on an area without nodes or edges.  If you single click on an area without nodes or edges, you can move the entire network around the field of view. To reset the view, click the Reset Viewport icon.
