You'll see the regular "Create Network" screen open, but once you click on the clipboard button, all the nodes that you've selected will now act as your start nodes. (If you wish to remove any of them, just click on the red sign next to it and it will automatically disappear.) Click Submit.

The next step will be choosing the facet "computed" placed under "EdgeType."

Once your list is updated, you can select all of the nodes with one click by checking the box next to "Subject," will find that the rest of the boxes underneath become checked as well. From there it's up to you what you would like to do with this selection from the options above the nodes.
