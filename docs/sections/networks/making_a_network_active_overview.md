# Making a Network Active Overview

If you need more information on the network before deciding to make it active, click the microscope. It will give you a preview of the network, if it's the one you hoped for then hover your mouse over the header until it turns a light green and click it.

   If you know which one you want and don't need the preview, then all you have to do is click on the network's space and it will automatically become active.

   Both methods will lead you to the same screen:

For example, if I only want to view a specific node and 2 steps following that node in any direction. I would simply select those options.
Not only will those options be selected in the tabular chart like so:
