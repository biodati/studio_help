# Hiding Nodes and Edges in Visualization

As you begin to get comfortable with lassoing, you might be wondering what features come along with it! Being able to hide a certain section of nodes and edges is one of them!

   After lassoing a section, look to the top where it reads "Hide Selection." Once you've clicked it, you'll notice that now all the nodes and edges that were grayed out after lassoing your section are now pulled to the front and the section you've lassoed is no longer visible

   Want to get those nodes and edges back in the picture? All you have to do is click "Show Selection."

   And just like that, everything is back to normal!
