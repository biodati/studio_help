# How to Add And Use Nodes in Your Clipboard

When you're on the 'Create a Network' screen you'll see a clipboard.

   This allows you to save certain nodes to use as a starting point when you're creating a network or just adding an edge to your network. Start off by finding a node or so that you'd like to use a base.

   Once you're on the 'Create a Network' page, you'll see that your clipboard has two nodes in it. Click on the clipboard, and it will show you which nodes you've saved onto it. If want to remove any of them, simply click the red sign next to them.
