# Source Code Editors

When exporting Networks or Nanopubs, you'll need a source code editor to view it on your computer since they export as .json and .jgf files. Here at BioDati Studio we use  [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)  and we love it. There are other options such as Sublime Text, Notepad++, etc.
