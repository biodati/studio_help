# Pinning Networks

If you've found a Network that you would like to add to a list for further review while still having the option to review other Networks, Pinning is the perfect feature for you to use.
Once a Network is selected, look to the top and you'll see a thumbtack.

   You'll know it's successfully pinned when the thumbtack turns from gray to yellow.

   To view all of your Pinned Networks, look to the side in the Facets section of the search results page.

   After checking the "Pinned" box, your pinned networks will appear on the right. Your pinned networks will still be filtered by other search filters (facets, filters and search terms). If you just want to see all of your pinned networks, remove the other search filters/queries.
