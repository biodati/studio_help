# Pinning Networks

If you've found a network that you would like to add to a list for further review, while still searching and reviewing other networks, Pinning is the perfect feature for you.

Hover your cursor over a network to reveal the thumbtack, and click it.

   You'll know it's successfully pinned when the thumbtack turns from gray to yellow.

   To view all of your Pinned Networks, look to the side in the Facets section of the search results page.

   After checking the "Pinned" box, your pinned networks will appear on the right. Your pinned networks can still be filtered by other search filters (facets, filters and search terms). If you just want to see all of your pinned networks, remove the other search filters/queries.

You can also pin a network from the Network Preview page, the Network page, and the Network List on the Project Page. Just look for the thumbtack.
