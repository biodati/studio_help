# Toggle Pathing in Visualization

When looking at a visualization, you might want to just see the pathing between two individual nodes.
The first thing you must do to accomplish this is to look on the top left hand of the visualization page and click the symbol that looks similar to the pin you might see on a map.

   After that you will see a little box pop up on the side.
You'll need to insert the node you would like to start from in the box under the word "Subject," followed by the node you want to end up at in the box under the word "Object."

   As you can see, after they've been inserted and you click "Find," you'll get a clear view of the path that connects those nodes!
