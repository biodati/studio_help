Once you have your very own Project to work with you can add NanoPubs to it. Find a nanopub that you wish to add to your project and click "Add To Workspace" above the nanopub's information.

There are several ways to get to the knowledge search page. You can start from the active project's page, the dashboard, or just to go to the top navigation search drop down and select "Knowledge." They will all lead you to the same spot.
Once on the knowledge search page, 1.) Search for the nanopub you'd like to place in your active project, 2.) Narrow down your search by using the facets if necessary. 3.) Click on the reference, and 4.) Select "Add To Project" in the options above the search area.
