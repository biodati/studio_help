# Activating a Project

In order to add things to your Project, you must first activate a workspace. From your dashboard, click on the "+" to create a new Project, or the magnifying glass to search one that is already created.

   If you created a project, your project will automatically be activated after it's created.
If you're choosing an already created project, hover over the project that you want and click the project name.

   Now that the project has been set to active, you can add items to it!
