# Activating a Project

In order to add things to your network, you must first activate a workspace. From your dashboard, click on the "+" to create or the magnifying glass to search one that is already created.

   If you created a project, your project will automatically be activated after it's created.
If you're choosing an already created project, hover over the project that you want and click the check mark.

   Now that the project has been set to active, you can add items to it!
