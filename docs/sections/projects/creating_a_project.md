# Creating a Project

Creating a project is an easy and really useful tool that BioDati Studio offers to help you keep all your data organized.
Once you're signed in to your BioDati account, you'll be on the dashboard. In the project box, click "CREATE."

   Once you've done so, choose a name for your workspace and write a description. This will dampen any future confusion you might have when you have plenty of projects.
