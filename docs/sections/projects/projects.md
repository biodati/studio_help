# Introduction to Projects

The Project Feature is designed to allow you to organize your workspace, by allowing you to group together nanopubs and networks. Like Networks and Knowledge, Projects are accessible from the Studio Dashboard.

To create a Project, click on the “+” in the project field, or use the create project tab on the drop-down in the banner.

A dialogue box will open. Enter the Project name and description. Click CREATE and the new Project Page will open.
   
The Project page displays the Name, description, and contents of a Project. It has links for adding and removing networks and nanopubs. Click the feather-pen to see the list of nanopubs in the project.

Recent Projects can be activated or loaded from the dashboard. When a Recent Project is activated, by clicking the slider button on the lower left, the bottom strip of the project box appears green and a check mark, the Active Icon, appears. Details about the Active Project will be displayed in the Project Field. The name of the Active Project will also appear at the left of the Banner.

Loading a Project will take you to the Project Page. You can load a project from the dashboard by clicking load in the recent project box. If the project is active, you can also LOAD by clicking the project name in the banner or clicking anywhere in the Project Field.

Search for a Project under Project Search, by clicking the search icon in the Project field, or using the drop-down Search menu in the banner.

Like Network Search, Project Search allows Keyword searches and facet filtering.

Hover over the project line to reveal Hover Icons. These icons will allow you to preview, activate, delete, or pin a Project. Only one Project can be active at a time. Activating a new project will automatically inactivate the old project. Active projects are highlighted on the Search page by a dark bar and a check mark. To Load a Project from Project Search, click on the Project name, either in the banner or in the search list.
